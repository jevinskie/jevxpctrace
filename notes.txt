Idea:
Frida xpc enumeration tweak

Objective: find xpc endpoints accessible from App Store container

Method:
Use existing apps on JBen phone

Inject into all apple processes a hook for processing incoming xpc call or maybe just the connection callback

Check if the caller is our or any container.sb process

If so set a flag for frida trace
New flag to only print traces if xpc handler is in callstack (tls flag? Pthread set specific or context?)

Exporting stack trace from calling processâ€¦

Idea: hook to pause calling process while sending message

In xpc handler hook in daemons, use coresymbolication on client, or call method exported by raw mach? to get call stack as collected by caller hook
